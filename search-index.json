For example: abort abort 42 The abort expression halts execution the current function and reverts all changes made to state by the current transaction (note though that this guarantee must be upheld by the adapter of the specific deployment of Move). There is no mechanism for \"catching\" or otherwise handling an abort. Luckily, in Move transactions are all or nothing, meaning any changes to storage are made all at once only if the transaction succeeds. For Sui, this means no objects are modified. Because of this transactional commitment of changes, after an abort there is no need to worry about backing out changes. While this approach is lacking in flexibility, it is incredibly simple and predictable. Similar to return, abort is useful for exiting control flow when some condition cannot be met. In this example, the function will pop two items off of the vector, but will abort early if the vector does not have two items use std::vector; fun pop_twice<T>(v: &mut vector<T>): (T, T) { if (v.length() < 2) abort 42; (v.pop_back(), v.pop_back()) } This is even more useful deep inside a control-flow construct. For example, this function checks that all numbers in the vector are less than the specified bound. And aborts otherwise use std::vector; fun check_vec(v: &vector<u64>, bound: u64) { let i = 0; let n = v.length(); while (i < n) { let cur = v[i]; if (cur > bound) abort 42; i = i + 1; } }","s":"abort","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/abort-and-assert","h":"#abort","p":1},{"i":6,"t":"assert is a builtin, macro operation provided by the Move compiler.

This is to convey that the arguments to assert are call-by-expression. In other words, assert is not a normal function and does not exist at the bytecode level. It is replaced inside the compiler with if (condition) () else abort code assert is more commonly used than just abort by itself. The abort examples above can be rewritten using assert use std::vector; fun pop_twice<T>(v: &mut vector<T>): (T, T) { assert!(v.length() >= 2, 42); // Now uses 'assert' (v.pop_back(), v.pop_back()) } and use std::vector; fun check_vec(v: &vector<u64>, bound: u64) { let i = 0; let n = v.length(); while (i < n) { let cur = v[i]; assert!(cur <= bound, 42); // Now uses 'assert' i = i + 1; } } Note that because the operation is replaced with this if-else, the argument for the code is not always evaluated.

See Conditional Abilities and Generic Types for more details. Immutable references & and mutable references &mut both have copy and drop. This refers to copying and dropping the reference itself, not what they refer to. References cannot appear in global storage, hence they do not have store. Note that none of the primitive types have key, meaning none of them can be used directly with storage operations.","s":"Builtin Types","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/abilities","h":"#builtin-types","p":11},{"i":26,"t":"To declare that a struct or enum has an ability, it is declared with has <ability> after the datatype name and either before or after the fields/variants.

Pair* and MyVec* both have copy, drop, and store. All of these abilities have strong guarantees over these gated operations. The operation can be performed on the value only if it has that ability; even if the value is deeply nested inside of some other collection! As such: when declaring a struct’s abilities, certain requirements are placed on the fields. All fields must satisfy these constraints. These rules are necessary so that structs satisfy the reachability rules for the abilities given above. If a struct is declared with the ability... copy, all fields must have copy. drop, all fields must have drop. store, all fields must have store. key, all fields must have store. key is the only ability currently that doesn’t require itself. An enum can have any of these abilities with the exception of key, which enums cannot have because they cannot be top-level values (objects) in storage. The same rules apply to fields of enum variants as they do for struct fields though. In particular, if an enum is declared with the ability... copy, all fields of all variants must have copy. drop, all fields of all variants must have drop. store, all fields of all variants must have store. key, is not allowed on enums as previously mentioned. For example: // A struct without any abilities public struct NoAbilities {} public struct WantsCopy has copy { f: NoAbilities, // ERROR 'NoAbilities' does not have 'copy' } public enum WantsCopyEnum has copy { Variant1 Variant2(NoAbilities), // ERROR 'NoAbilities' does not have 'copy' } and similarly: // A struct without any abilities public struct NoAbilities {} public struct MyData has key { f: NoAbilities, // Error 'NoAbilities' does not have 'store' } public struct MyDataEnum has store { Variant1, Variant2(NoAbilities), // Error 'NoAbilities' does not have 'store' }","s":"Annotating Structs and Enums","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/abilities","h":"#annotating-structs-and-enums","p":11},{"i":28,"t":"When abilities are annotated on a generic type, not all instances of that type are guaranteed to have that ability. Consider this struct declaration: public struct Cup<T> has copy, drop, store, key { item: T } It might be very helpful if Cup could hold any type, regardless of its abilities. The type system can see the type parameter, so it should be able to remove abilities from Cup if it sees a type parameter that would violate the guarantees for that ability. This behavior might sound a bit confusing at first, but it might be more understandable if we think about collection types. We could consider the builtin type vector to have the following type declaration: vector<T> has copy, drop, store; We want vectors to work with any type. We don't want separate vector types for different abilities. So what are the rules we would want? Precisely the same that we would want with the field rules above. So, it would be safe to copy a vector value only if the inner elements can be copied. It would be safe to ignore a vector value only if the inner elements can be ignored/dropped. And, it would be safe to put a vector in storage only if the inner elements can be in storage. To have this extra expressiveness, a type might not have all the abilities it was declared with depending on the instantiation of that type; instead, the abilities a type will have depends on both its declaration and its type arguments. For any type, type parameters are pessimistically assumed to be used inside of the struct, so the abilities are only granted if the type parameters meet the requirements described above for fields. Taking Cup from above as an example: Cup has the ability copy only if T has copy. It has drop only if T has drop. It has store only if T has store. It has key only if T has store.

For example, we can nest two loops and use break and continue with those labels to precisely specify control flow. You can prefix any loop or while form with a 'label: form to allow breaking or continuing directly there. To demonstrate this behavior, consider a function that takes nested vectors of numbers (i.e., vector<vector<u64>>) to sum against some threshold, which behaves as follows: If the sum of all the numbers are under the threshold, return that sum. If adding a number to the current sum would surpass the threshold, return the current sum. We can write this by iterating over the vector of vectors as nested loops and labelling the outer one. If any addition in the inner loop would push us over the threshold, we can use break with the outer label to escape both loops at once: fun sum_until_threshold(input: &vector<vector<u64>>, threshold: u64): u64 { let mut sum = 0; let mut i = 0; let input_size = input.length(); 'outer: loop { // breaks to outer since it is the closest enclosing loop if (i >= input_size) break sum; let vec = &input[i]; let size = vec.length(); let mut j = 0; while (j < size) { let v_entry = vec[j]; if (sum + v_entry < threshold) { sum = sum + v_entry; } else { // the next element we saw would break the threshold, // so we return the current sum break 'outer sum }; j = j + 1; }; i = i + 1; } } These sorts of labels can also be used with a nested loop form, providing precise control in larger bodies of code. For example, if we were processing a large table where each entry required iteration that might see us continuing the inner or outer loop, we could express that code using labels: let x = 'outer: loop { ... 'inner: while (cond) { ... if (cond0) { break 'outer value }; ... if (cond1) { continue 'inner } else if (cond2) { continue 'outer } ... } ... };","s":"Loops","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/control-flow/labeled-control-flow","h":"#loops","p":83},{"i":88,"t":"Labeled blocks allow you to write Move programs that contain intra-function non-local control flow, including inside of macro lambdas and returning values: fun named_return(n: u64): vector<u8> { let x = 'a: { if (n % 2 == 0) { return 'a b\"even\" }; b\"odd\" }; x } In this simple example, the program checks if the input n is even. If it is, the program leaves the block labeled 'a: with the value b\"even\". If not, the code continues, ending the block labeled 'a: with the value b\"odd\". At the end, we set x to the value and then return it. This control flow feature works across macro bodies as well. For example, suppose we wanted to write a function to find the first even number in a vector, and that we have some macro for_ref that iterates the vector elements in a loop: macro fun for_ref<$T>($vs: &vector<$T>, $f: |&$T|) { let vs = $vs; let mut i = 0; let end = vs.length(); while (i < end) { $f(vs.borrow(i)); i = i + 1; } } Using for_ref and a label, we can write a lambda expression to pass for_ref that will escape the loop, returning the first even number it finds: fun find_first_even(vs: vector<u64>): Option<u64> { 'result: { for_ref!(&vs, |n| if (*n % 2 == 0) { return 'result option::some(*n)}); option::none() } } This function will iterate vs until it finds an even number, and return that (or return option::none() if no even number exists).

Instead, to access fields within a variant -- either by value, or immutable or mutable reference -- you must use pattern matching. You can pattern match on Move values by value, immutable reference, and mutable reference. When pattern matching by value, the value is moved into the match arm. When pattern matching by reference, the value is borrowed into the match arm (either immutably or mutably). We'll go through a brief description of pattern matching using match here, but for more information on pattern matching using match in Move see the Pattern Matching section. A match statement is used to pattern match on a Move value and consists of a number of match arms. Each match arm consists of a pattern, an arrow =>, and an expression, followed by a comma ,. The pattern can be a struct, enum variant, binding (x, y), wildcard (_ or ..), constant (ConstValue), or literal value (true, 42, and so on). The value is matched against each pattern from the top-down, and will match the first pattern that structurally matches the value. Once the value is matched, the expression on the right hand side of the => is executed. Additionally, match arms can have optional guards that are checked after the pattern matches but before the expression is executed. Guards are specified by the if keyword followed by an expression that must evaluate to a boolean value before the =>. module a::m; public enum Action has drop { Stop, Pause { duration: u32 }, MoveTo { x: u64, y: u64 }, Jump(u64), } public struct GameState { // Fields containing a game state character_x: u64, character_y: u64, character_height: u64, // ... } fun perform_action(stat: &mut GameState, action: Action) { match (action) { // Handle the `Stop` variant Action::Stop => state.stop(), // Handle the `Pause` variant // If the duration is 0, do nothing Action::Pause { duration: 0 } => (), Action::Pause { duration } => state.pause(duration), // Handle the `MoveTo` variant Action::MoveTo { x, y } => state.move_to(x, y), // Handle the `Jump` variant // if the game disallows jumps then do nothing Action::Jump(_) if (state.jumps_not_allowed()) => (), // otherwise, jump to the specified height Action::Jump(height) => state.jump(height), } } To see how to pattern match on an enum to update values within it mutably, let's take the following example of a simple enum that has two variants, each with a single field. We can then write two functions, one that only increments the value of the first variant, and another that only increments the value of the second variant: module a::m; public enum SimpleEnum { Variant1(u64), Variant2(u64), } public fun incr_enum_variant1(simple_enum: &mut SimpleEnum) { match (simple_enum) { SimpleEnum::Variant1(mut value) => *value += 1, _ => (), } } public fun incr_enum_variant2(simple_enum: &mut SimpleEnum) { match (simple_enum) { SimpleEnum::Variant2(mut value) => *value += 1, _ => (), } } Now, if we have a value of SimpleEnum we can use the functions to increment the value of this variant: let mut x = SimpleEnum::Variant1(10); incr_enum_variant1(&mut x); assert!(x == SimpleEnum::Variant1(11)); // Doesn't increment since it increments a different variant incr_enum_variant2(&mut x); assert!(x == SimpleEnum::Variant1(11)); When pattern matching on a Move value that does not have the drop ability, the value must be consumed or destructured in each match arm. If the value is not consumed or destructured in a match arm, the compiler will raise an error. This is to ensure that all possible values are handled in the match statement. As an example, consider the following code: module a::m; public enum X { Variant { x: u64 } } public fun bad(x: X) { match (x) { _ => (), // ^ ERROR! value of type `X` is not consumed or destructured in this match arm } } To properly handle this, you will need to destructure X and all its variants in the match's arm(s): module a::m; public enum X { Variant { x: u64 } } public fun good(x: X) { match (x) { // OK!

It takes an immutable reference of the subject type and returns an immutable reference to the element type. The borrow function defined in std::vector is an example of this: #[syntax(index)] public native fun borrow<Element>(v: &vector<Element>, i: u64): &Element; Mutable Accessor​ The mutable index syntax method is the dual of the immutable one, allowing for both read and write operations.

The Move compiler uses the mutability marker to determine which borrow form to call to produce a reference of the appropriate mutability. As a result, we disallow index syntax methods whose subject and return mutability differ: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_imm(x: &mut Matrix<u64>, ...): &u64 { ... } // ERROR! incompatible mutability // expected a mutable reference '&mut' return type","s":"Type Constraints","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/index-syntax","h":"#type-constraints","p":160},{"i":175,"t":"When defining an immutable and mutable index syntax method pair, they are subject to a number of compatibility constraints: They must take the same number of type parameters, those type parameters must have the same constraints.

All other parameter types must match exactly. These constraints are to ensure that index syntax behaves identically regardless of being in a mutable or immutable position. To illustrate some of these errors, recall the previous Matrix definition: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow<T>(s: &Matrix<T>, i: u64, j: u64): &T { vector::borrow(vector::borrow(&s.v, i), j) } All of the following are type-incompatible definitions of the mutable version: #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_mut<T: drop>(s: &mut Matrix<T>, i: u64, j: u64): &mut T { ... } // ERROR! `T` has `drop` here, but no in the immutable version #[syntax(index)] public fun borrow_mut(s: &mut Matrix<u64>, i: u64, j: u64): &mut u64 { ... } // ERROR!

Move allows unused type parameters so the following struct definition is valid: public struct Foo<T> { foo: u64 } This can be convenient when modeling certain concepts. Here is an example: module a::m; // Currency Specifiers public struct A {} public struct B {} // A generic coin type that can be instantiated using a currency // specifier type. // e.g. Coin<A>, Coin<B> etc. public struct Coin<Currency> has store { value: u64 } // Write code generically about all currencies public fun mint_generic<Currency>(value: u64): Coin<Currency> { Coin { value } } // Write code concretely about one currency public fun mint_a(value: u64): Coin<A> { mint_generic(value) } public fun mint_b(value: u64): Coin<B> { mint_generic(value) } In this example, Coin<Currency> is generic on the Currency type parameter, which specifies the currency of the coin and allows code to be written either generically on any currency or concretely on a specific currency.

This is because of the rules for Conditional Abilities and Generic Types and the fact that A and B don't have the store ability, despite the fact that they are not even used in the body of struct Coin. This might cause some unpleasant consequences. For example, we are unable to put Coin<A> into a wallet in storage. One possible solution would be to add spurious ability annotations to A and B (i.e., public struct Currency1 has store {}). But, this might lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities because it weakens the types with unnecessary ability declarations. For example, we would never expect a value in the storage to have a field in type A, but this would be possible with the spurious store ability. Moreover, the spurious annotations would be infectious, requiring many functions generic on the unused type parameter to also include the necessary constraints. Phantom type parameters solve this problem. Unused type parameters can be marked as phantom type parameters, which do not participate in the ability derivation for structs. In this way, arguments to phantom type parameters are not considered when deriving the abilities for generic types, thus avoiding the need for spurious ability annotations. For this relaxed rule to be sound, Move's type system guarantees that a parameter declared as phantom is either not used at all in the struct definition, or it is only used as an argument to type parameters also declared as phantom. Declaration​ In a struct definition a type parameter can be declared as phantom by adding the phantom keyword before its declaration. public struct Coin<phantom Currency> has store { value: u64 } If a type parameter is declared as phantom we say it is a phantom type parameter. When defining a struct, Move's type checker ensures that every phantom type parameter is either not used inside the struct definition or it is only used as an argument to a phantom type parameter. public struct S1<phantom T1, T2> { f: u64 } // ^^^^^^^ valid, T1 does not appear inside the struct definition public struct S2<phantom T1, T2> { f: S1<T1, T2> } // ^^^^^^^ valid, T1 appears in phantom position The following code shows examples of violations of the rule: public struct S1<phantom T> { f: T } // ^^^^^^^ ERROR! ^ Not a phantom position public struct S2<T> { f: T } public struct S3<phantom T> { f: S2<T> } // ^^^^^^^ ERROR! ^ Not a phantom position More formally, if a type is used as an argument to a phantom type parameter we say the type appears in phantom position. With this definition in place, the rule for the correct use of phantom parameters can be specified as follows: A phantom type parameter can only appear in phantom position. Note that specifying phantom is not required, but the compiler will warn if a type parameter could be phantom but was not marked as such. Instantiation​ When instantiating a struct, the arguments to phantom parameters are excluded when deriving the struct abilities. For example, consider the following code: public struct S<T1, phantom T2> has copy { f: T1 } public struct NoCopy {} public struct HasCopy has copy {} Consider now the type S<HasCopy, NoCopy>. Since S is defined with copy and all non-phantom arguments have copy then S<HasCopy, NoCopy> also has copy. Phantom Type Parameters with Ability Constraints​ Ability constraints and phantom type parameters are orthogonal features in the sense that phantom parameters can be declared with ability constraints. public struct S<phantom T: copy> {} When instantiating a phantom type parameter with an ability constraint, the type argument has to satisfy that constraint, even though the parameter is phantom. The usual restrictions apply and T can only be instantiated with arguments having copy.","s":"Phantom Type Parameters","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/generics","h":"#phantom-type-parameters","p":184},{"i":210,"t":"In the examples above, we have demonstrated how one can use type parameters to define \"unknown\" types that can be plugged in by callers at a later time.

The first: [package] name = \"example_pkg\" ... [addresses] named_addr = \"_\" Declares named_addr as a named address in the package example_pkg and that this address can be any valid address value. In particular, an importing package can pick the value of the named address named_addr to be any address it wishes. Intuitively you can think of this as parameterizing the package example_pkg by the named address named_addr, and the package can then be instantiated later on by an importing package. named_addr can also be declared as: [package] name = \"example_pkg\" ... [addresses] named_addr = \"0xCAFE\" which states that the named address named_addr is exactly 0xCAFE and cannot be changed. This is useful so other importing packages can use this named address without needing to worry about the exact value assigned to it. With these two different declaration methods, there are two ways that information about named addresses can flow in the package graph: The former (\"unassigned named addresses\") allows named address values to flow from the importation site to the declaration site. The latter (\"assigned named addresses\") allows named address values to flow from the declaration site upwards in the package graph to usage sites. With these two methods for flowing named address information throughout the package graph the rules around scoping and renaming become important to understand.","s":"Declaring Named Addresses","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/packages","h":"#declaring-named-addresses","p":222},{"i":233,"t":"A named address N in a package P is in scope if: P declares a named address N; or A package in one of P's transitive dependencies declares the named address N and there is a dependency path in the package graph between between P and the declaring package of N with no renaming of N. Additionally, every named address in a package is exported. Because of this and the above scoping rules each package can be viewed as coming with a set of named addresses that will be brought into scope when the package is imported, e.g., if you import example_pkg, that import will also bring the named_addr named address into scope. Because of this, if P imports two packages P1 and P2 both of which declare a named address N an issue arises in P: which \"N\" is meant when N is referred to in P? The one from P1 or P2? To prevent this ambiguity around which package a named address is coming from, we enforce that the sets of scopes introduced by all dependencies in a package are disjoint, and provide a way to rename named addresses when the package that brings them into scope is imported. Renaming a named address when importing can be done as follows in our P, P1, and P2 example above: [package] name = \"P\" ... [dependencies] P1 = { local = \"some_path_to_P1\", addr_subst = { \"P1N\" = \"N\" } } P2 = { local = \"some_path_to_P2\" } With this renaming N refers to the N from P2 and P1N will refer to N coming from P1: module N::A { public fun x(): address { @P1N } } It is important to note that renaming is not local: once a named address N has been renamed to N2 in a package P all packages that import P will not see N but only N2 unless N is reintroduced from outside of P.

For Sui, address is used to represent \"accounts\", and also objects via strong type wrappers (with sui::object::UID and sui::object::ID). Although an address is a 256 bit integer under the hood, Move addresses are intentionally opaque---they cannot be created from integers, they do not support arithmetic operations, and they cannot be modified. Specific deployments of Move might have native functions to enable some of these operations (e.g., creating an address from bytes vector<u8>), but these are not part of the Move language itself.

For example module a::cup; public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun cup_borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } public fun cup_value<T>(c: Cup<T>): T { let Cup(t) = c; t } public fun cup_swap<T: drop>(c: &mut Cup<T>, t: T) { c.0 = t; } We can now create use fun aliases to these functions module b::example; use fun a::cup::cup_borrow as Cup.borrow; use fun a::cup::cup_value as Cup.value; use fun a::cup::cup_swap as Cup.set; fun example(c: &mut Cup<u64>) { let _ = c.borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow let v = c.value(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_value c.set(v * 2); // resolves to a::cup::cup_swap } Note that the <function> in the use fun does not have to be a fully resolved path, and an alias can be used instead, so the declarations in the above example could equivalently be written as use a::cup::{Self, cup_swap}; use fun cup::cup_borrow as Cup.borrow; use fun cup::cup_value as Cup.value; use fun cup_swap as Cup.set; While these examples are cute for renaming the functions in the current module, the feature is perhaps more useful for declaring methods on types from other modules. For example, if we wanted to add a new utility to Cup, we could do so with a use fun alias and still use method syntax module b::example; fun double(c: &Cup<u64>): Cup<u64> { let v = c.value(); Cup::new(v * 2) } Normally, we would be stuck having to call it as double(&c) because b::example did not define Cup, but instead we can use a use fun alias fun double_double(c: Cup<u64>): (Cup<u64>, Cup<u64>) { use fun b::example::double as Cup.dub; (c.dub(), c.dub()) // resolves to b::example::double in both calls } While use fun can be made in any scope, the target <function> of the use fun must have a first argument that is the same as the <type>. public struct X() has copy, drop, store; fun new(): X { X() } fun flag(flag: bool): u8 { if (flag) 1 else 0 } use fun new as X.new; // ERROR! use fun flag as X.flag; // ERROR! // Neither `new` nor `flag` has first argument of type `X` But any first argument of the <type> can be used, including references and mutable references public struct X() has copy, drop, store; public fun by_val(_: X) {} public fun by_ref(_: &X) {} public fun by_mut(_: &mut X) {} // All 3 valid, in any scope use fun by_val as X.v; use fun by_ref as X.r; use fun by_mut as X.m; Note for generics, the methods are associated for all instances of the generic type. You cannot overload the method to resolve to different functions depending on the instantiation. public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun value<T: copy>(c: &Cup<T>): T { c.0 } use fun value as Cup<bool>.flag; // ERROR! use fun value as Cup<u64>.num; // ERROR! // In both cases, `use fun` aliases cannot be generic, they must work for all instances of the type","s":"use fun Aliases","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/method-syntax","h":"#use-fun-aliases","p":357},{"i":368,"t":"Unlike a traditional use, the use fun statement can be made public, which allows it to be used outside of its declared scope. A use fun can be made public if it is declared in the module that defines the receivers type, much like the method aliases that are automatically created for functions in the defining module. Or conversely, one can think that an implicit public use fun is created automatically for every function in the defining module that has a first argument of the receiver type (if it is defined in that module). Both of these views are equivalent. module a::cup; public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public use fun cup_borrow as Cup.borrow; public fun cup_borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } In this example, a public method alias is created for a::cup::Cup.borrow and a::cup::Cup.cup_borrow. Both resolve to a::cup::cup_borrow. And both are \"public\" in the sense that they can be used outside of a::cup, without an additional use or use fun. module b::example; fun example<T: drop>(c: a::cup::Cup<u64>) { c.borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow c.cup_borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow } The public use fun declarations thus serve as a way of renaming a function if you want to give it a cleaner name for use with method syntax. This is especially helpful if you have a module with multiple types, and similarly named functions for each type. module a::shapes; public struct Rectangle { base: u64, height: u64 } public struct Box { base: u64, height: u64, depth: u64 } // Rectangle and Box can have methods with the same name public use fun rectangle_base as Rectangle.base; public fun rectangle_base(rectangle: &Rectangle): u64 { rectangle.base } public use fun box_base as Box.base; public fun box_base(box: &Box): u64 { box.base } Another use for public use fun is adding methods to types from other modules. This can be helpful in conjunction with functions spread out across a single package. module a::cup { public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun new<T>(t: T): Cup<T> { Cup(t) } public fun borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } // `public use fun` to a function defined in another module public use fun a::utils::split as Cup.split; } module a::utils { use a::m::{Self, Cup}; public fun split<u64>(c: Cup<u64>): (Cup<u64>, Cup<u64>) { let Cup(t) = c; let half = t / 2; let rem = if (t > 0) t - half else 0; (cup::new(half), cup::new(rem)) } } And note that this public use fun does not create a circular dependency, as the use fun is not present after the module is compiled--all methods are resolved statically.","s":"public use fun Aliases","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/method-syntax","h":"#public-use-fun-aliases","p":357},{"i":370,"t":"A small detail to note is that method aliases respect normal use aliases. module a::cup { public struct Cup<T>(T) has copy, drop, store; public fun cup_borrow<T>(c: &Cup<T>): &T { &c.0 } } module b::other { use a::cup::{Cup, cup_borrow as borrow}; fun example(c: &Cup<u64>) { c.borrow(); // resolves to a::cup::cup_borrow } } A helpful way to think about this is that use creates an implicit use fun alias for the function whenever it can. In this case the use a::cup::cup_borrow as borrow creates an implicit use fun a::cup::cup_borrow as Cup.borrow because it would be a valid use fun alias. Both views are equivalent.

Move is designed around the following values: Secure by default: Insecure languages are a serious barrier both to accessible smart contract development and to mainstream adoption of digital assets. The first duty of a smart contract language is to prevent as many potential safety issues as possible (e.g. re-entrancy, missing access control checks, arithmetic overflow, ...) by construction. Any changes to Move should preserve or enhance its existing security guarantees. Expressive by nature: Move must enable programmers to write any smart contract they can imagine. But we care as much about the way it feels to write Move as we do about what Move allows you to do - the language should be rich enough that the features needed for a task are available, and minimal enough that the choice is obvious. The Move toolchain should be a productivity enhancer and a thought partner. Intuitive for all: Smart contracts are only one part of a useful application. Move should understand the broader context of its usage and design with both the smart contract developer and the application developer in mind. It should be easy for developers to learn how to read Move-managed state, build Move powered transactions, and write new Move code. The core technical elements of Move are: Safe, familiar, and flexible abstractions for digital assets via programmable objects. A rich ability system (inspired by linear types) that gives programmers extreme control of how values are created, destroyed, stored, copied, and transferred. A module system with strong encapsulation features to enable code reuse while maintaining this control. Dynamic fields for creating hierarchical relationships between objects. Programmable transaction blocks (PTBs) to enable atomic client-side composition of Move-powered APIs. Move was born in 2018 as part of Facebook's Libra project. It was publicly revealed in 2019, the first Move-powered network launched in 2020. As of April 2024, there are numerous Move-powered chains in production with several more in the works. Move is an embedded language with a platform-agnostic core, which means it takes on a slightly different personality in each chain that uses it. Creating a new programming language and bootstrapping a community around it is an ambitious, long term project. A language has to be an order of magnitude better than alternatives in relevant ways to have a chance, but even then the quality of the community matters more than the technical fundamentals. Move is a young language, but it's off to a good start in terms of both differentiation and community. A small, but fanatical group of smart contract programmers and core contributors united by the Move values are pushing the boundaries of what smart contracts can do, the applications they can enable, and who can (safely) write them.

While this behavior is provided by default when working with numbers or other primitive types, it is not the default for custom types. Move is designed to express digital assets and resources, and controlling the ability to duplicate resources is a key principle of the resource model. However, the Move type system allows you to add the copy ability to custom types: public struct Copyable has copy {} In the example above, we define a custom type Copyable with the copy ability. This means that instances of Copyable can be copied, both implicitly and explicitly. let a = Copyable {}; // allowed because the Copyable struct has the `copy` ability let b = a; // `a` is copied to `b` let c = *&b; // explicit copy via dereference operator // Copyable doesn't have the `drop` ability, so every instance (a, b, and c) must // be used or explicitly destructured. The `drop` ability is explained below. let Copyable {} = a; let Copyable {} = b; let Copyable {} = c; In the example above, a is copied to b implicitly, and then explicitly copied to c using the dereference operator. If Copyable did not have the copy ability, the code would not compile, and the Move compiler would raise an error. Note: In Move, destructuring with empty brackets is often used to consume unused variables, especially for types without the drop ability. This prevents compiler errors from values going out of scope without explicit use.

In many programming languages this behavior is considered default. However, in Move, a struct without the drop ability is not allowed to be ignored.

An attempt to ignore a struct without the drop ability will result in a compilation error. module book::drop_ability; /// This struct has the `drop` ability. public struct IgnoreMe has drop { a: u8, b: u8, } /// This struct does not have the `drop` ability. public struct NoDrop {} #[test] // Create an instance of the `IgnoreMe` struct and ignore it. // Even though we constructed the instance, we don't need to unpack it. fun test_ignore() { let no_drop = NoDrop {}; let _ = IgnoreMe { a: 1, b: 2 }; // no need to unpack // The value must be unpacked for the code to compile. let NoDrop {} = no_drop; // OK } The drop ability is often used on custom collection types to eliminate the need for special handling of the collection when it is no longer needed. For example, a vector type has the drop ability, which allows the vector to be ignored when it is no longer needed. However, the biggest feature of Move's type system is the ability to not have drop.

The else keyword is optional, except when the resulting value is assigned to a variable, as all branches must return a value to ensure type safety. Let’s examine how an if expression works in Move with the following example: #[test] fun test_if() { let x = 5; // `x > 0` is a boolean expression. if (x > 0) { std::debug::print(&b\"X is bigger than 0\".to_string()) }; } Let's see how we can use if and else to assign a value to a variable: #[test] fun test_if_else() { let x = 5; let y = if (x > 0) { 1 } else { 0 }; assert!(y == 1); } In this example, the value of the if expression is assigned to the variable y. If x is greater than 0, y is assigned the value 1; otherwise, it is assigned 0. The else block is required because both branches of the if expression must return a value of the same type. Omitting the else block would result in a compiler error, as it ensures all possible branches are accounted for and type safety is maintained. Conditional expressions are among the most important control flow statements in Move. They evaluate user-provided input or stored data to make decisions.

The syntax for creating a loop is straightforward: loop { <expressions>; }; Let's rewrite the previous example using loop instead of while: #[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)] fun test_infinite_loop() { let mut x = 0; // This will loop forever. loop { x = x + 1; }; // This line will never be executed. assert!(x == 5); } Infinite loops are rarely practical in Move, as every operation consumes gas, and an infinite loop will inevitably lead to gas exhaustion.

It is often used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met. To illustrate this point, let's turn the infinite loop from the previous example into something that looks and behaves more like a while loop: #[test] fun test_break_loop() { let mut x = 0; // This will loop until `x` is 5. loop { x = x + 1; // If `x` is 5, then exit the loop. if (x == 5) { break // Exit the loop. } }; assert!(x == 5); } Almost identical to the while loop, right?

For that Move offers pattern matching syntax. This chapter doesn't intend to cover all the features of pattern matching in Move. Refer to the Pattern Matching section in the Move Reference. Pattern matching allows conditioning the logic based on the pattern of the value. It is performed using the match expression, followed by the matched value in parenthesis and the block of match arms, defining the patten and expression to be performed if the pattern is right.

Each match arm checks for a specific variant of the Segment enum. If s matches Segment::Empty, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

For these situations, match supports a wildcard pattern (_), which acts as a default arm. This arm is executed when no other patterns match. We can demonstrate this by simplifying our is_empty function and replacing the non-Empty variants with a wildcard: public fun is_empty(s: &Segment): bool { file=packages/samples/sources/move-basics/enum-and anchor=matcmove:is_empty_2}} Similarly, we can use the same approach to define is_special and is_string: /// Whether this is a `Special` segment. public fun is_special(s: &Segment): bool { match (s) { // Hint: the `..` ignores inner fields Segment::Special { .. } => true, _ => false, } } /// Whether this is a `String` segment. public fun is_string(s: &Segment): bool { match (s) { Segment::String(_) => true, _ => false, } }","s":"Trick #1 - any Condition","u":"/docusaurus-test/move-basics/enum-and-match","h":"#trick-1---any-condition","p":666},{"i":679,"t":"With the addition of is_variant functions, we enabled external modules to check which variant an enum instance represents.

For example, the ERC-20 standard in Ethereum pioneered a set of standards to interact with digital currency tokens, establishing a blueprint for creating and managing digital currencies on the blockchain. Subsequently, the introduction of the ERC-721 standard marked a significant evolution, popularizing the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which represent unique, indivisible assets. These standards laid the groundwork for the complex digital assets we see today. However, Ethereum's programming model lacked a native representation of assets. In other words, externally, a Smart Contract behaved like an asset, but the language itself did not have a way to inherently represent assets. From the start, Move aimed to provide a first-class abstraction for assets, opening up new avenues for thinking about and programming assets. It is important to highlight which properties are essential for an asset: Ownership: Every asset is associated with an owner(s), mirroring the straightforward concept of ownership in the physical world—just as you own a car, you can own a digital asset. Move enforces ownership in such a way that once an asset is moved, the previous owner completely loses any control over it. This mechanism ensures a clear and secure change of ownership. Non-copyable: In the real world, unique items cannot be duplicated effortlessly. Move applies this principle to digital assets, ensuring they cannot be arbitrarily copied within the program. This property is crucial for maintaining the scarcity and uniqueness of digital assets, mirroring the intrinsic value of physical assets. Non-discardable: Just as you cannot accidentally lose a house or a car without a trace, Move ensures that no asset can be discarded or lost in a program. Instead, assets must be explicitly transferred or destroyed. This property guarantees the deliberate handling of digital assets, preventing accidental loss and ensuring accountability in asset management. Move managed to encapsulate these properties in its design, becoming an ideal language for digital assets.","s":"Move - Language for Digital Assets","u":"/docusaurus-test/object/digital-assets","h":"","p":853},{"i":856,"t":"Move was designed to provide a first-class abstraction for digital assets, enabling developers to create and manage assets natively.

Another drawback of the original design was the lack of built-in support for a \"transfer\" operation, requiring every module to implement its own storage transfer logic. Additionally, managing heterogeneous collections of assets in a single account was particularly challenging. Sui addressed these challenges by redesigning the storage and ownership model of objects to more closely resemble real-world object interactions.

These objects have their own type and associated behaviors, a unique identifier, and support native storage operations like transfer and share. Designed to be intuitive and easy to use, the Object Model enables a wide range of use cases to be implemented with ease. Objects in Sui have the following properties: Type: Every object has a type, defining the structure and behavior of the object. Objects of different types cannot be mixed or used interchangeably, ensuring objects are used correctly according to their type system. Unique ID: Each object has a unique identifier, distinguishing it from other objects. This ID is generated upon the object's creation and is immutable. It's used to track and identify objects within the system. Owner: Every object is associated with an owner, who has control over changes to the object. Ownership on Sui can be exclusive to an account, shared across the network, or frozen, allowing read-only access without modification or transfer capabilities. We will discuss ownership in more detail in the following sections. Note that ownership does not control the confidentiality of an object — it is always possible to read the contents of an on-chain object from outside of Move. You should never store unencrypted secrets inside of objects. Data: Objects encapsulate their data, simplifying management and manipulation. The data structure and operations are defined by the object's type. Version: The transition from accounts to objects is facilitated by object versioning. Traditionally, blockchains use a nonce to prevent replay attacks. In Sui, the object's version acts as a nonce, preventing replay attacks for each object. Digest: Every object has a digest, which is a hash of the object's data. The digest is used to cryptographically verify the integrity of the object's data and ensures that it has not been tampered with. The digest is calculated when the object is created and is updated whenever the object's data changes.","s":"What is an Object?","u":"/docusaurus-test/object/object-model","h":"","p":901},{"i":904,"t":"Objects in Sui are high-level abstractions representing digital assets.

Here, an object is owned by a single account, granting that account exclusive control over the object within the behaviors associated with its type. This model embodies the concept of true ownership, where the account possesses complete authority over the object, making it inaccessible to others for modification or transfer. This level of ownership clarity is a significant advantage over other blockchain systems, where ownership definitions can be more ambiguous, and smart contracts may have the ability to alter or transfer assets without the owner's consent.","s":"Account Owner (or Single Owner)","u":"/docusaurus-test/object/ownership","h":"#account-owner-or-single-owner","p":908},{"i":913,"t":"Single owner model has its limitations: for example, it is very tricky to implement a marketplace for digital assets without a shared state. For a generic marketplace scenario, imagine that Alice owns an asset X, and she wants to sell it by putting it into a shared marketplace. Then Bob can come and buy the asset directly from the marketplace. The reason why this is tricky is that it is impossible to write a smart contract that would \"lock\" the asset in Alice's account and take it out when Bob buys it. First, it will be a violation of the single owner model, and second, it requires a shared access to the asset. To facilitate a problem of shared data access, Sui has introduced a shared ownership model. In this model, an object can be shared with the network. Shared objects can be read and modified by any account on the network, and the rules of interaction are defined by the implementation of the object. Typical uses for shared objects are: marketplaces, shared resources, escrows, and other scenarios where multiple accounts need access to the same state.","s":"Shared State","u":"/docusaurus-test/object/ownership","h":"#shared-state","p":908},{"i":915,"t":"Sui also offers the frozen object model, where an object becomes permanently read-only.

A use case we love to mention is a game character. Alice can own the Hero object from a game, and the Hero can own items: also represented as objects, like a \"Map\", or a \"Compass\". Alice may take the \"Map\" from the \"Hero\" object, and then send it to Bob, or sell it on a marketplace.

And in other smart-contract languages, authorization is often performed by checking the address of the sender. This pattern is still viable on Sui, however, overall recommendation is to use capabilities for better security, discoverability, and code organization. Let's look at how the new function that creates a user would look like if it was using the address check: /// Error code for unauthorized access. const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0; /// The application admin address. const APPLICATION_ADMIN: address = @0xa11ce; /// Creates a new user in the system. Requires the sender to be the application /// admin. public fun new(ctx: &mut TxContext): User { assert!(ctx.sender() == APPLICATION_ADMIN, ENotAuthorized); User { id: object::new(ctx) } } And now, let's see how the same function would look like with the capability: /// Grants the owner the right to create new users in the system. public struct AdminCap {} /// Creates a new user in the system. Requires the `AdminCap` capability to be /// passed as the first argument. public fun new(_: &AdminCap, ctx: &mut TxContext): User { User { id: object::new(ctx) } } Using capabilities has several advantages over the address check: Migration of admin rights is easier with capabilities due to them being objects. In case of address, if the admin address changes, all the functions that check the address need to be updated - hence, require a package upgrade. Function signatures are more descriptive with capabilities. It is clear that the new function requires the AdminCap to be passed as an argument. And this function can't be called without it. Object Capabilities don't require extra checks in the function body, and hence, decrease the chance of a developer mistake. An owned Capability also serves in discovery. The owner of the AdminCap can see the object in their account (via a Wallet or Explorer), and know that they have the admin rights. This is less transparent with the address check. However, the address approach has its own advantages. For example, if an address is multisig, and transaction building gets more complex, it might be easier to check the address. Also, if there's a central object of the application that is used in every function, it can store the admin address, and this would simplify migration. The central object approach is also valuable for revokable capabilities, where the admin can revoke the capability from the user.","s":"Address Check vs Capability","u":"/docusaurus-test/programmability/capability","h":"#address-check-vs-capability","p":923},{"i":932,"t":"Collection types are a fundamental part of any programming language.

The coffee cup, on the other hand, is a private resource - it belongs to a specific person, and only that person can use it. To make coffee, one needs to use the coffee machine and wait if there's someone else using it.

It is important that you understand these concepts when using storage functions. Here is a quick recap of the most important points: The move semantics in Move means that the value is moved from one scope to another. In other words, if an instance of a type is passed to a function by value, it is moved to the function scope and can't be accessed in the caller scope anymore. To maintain the ownership of the value, you can pass it by reference. Either by immutable reference &T or mutable reference &mut T. Then the value is borrowed and can be accessed in the callee scope, however the owner stays the same. /// Moved by value public fun take<T>(value: T) { /* value is moved here! */ abort 0 } /// For immutable reference public fun borrow<T>(value: &T) { /* value is borrowed here! can be read */ abort 0 } /// For mutable reference public fun borrow_mut<T>(value: &mut T) { /* value is mutably borrowed here! */ abort 0 }","s":"Ownership and References: a Quick Recap","u":"/docusaurus-test/storage/storage-functions","h":"#ownership-and-references-a-quick-recap","p":1195},{"i":1202,"t":"The transfer::transfer function is a public function used to transfer an object to another address. Its signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the key ability and an address of the recipient. Please, note that the object is passed into the function by value, therefore it is moved to the function scope and then moved to the recipient address: module sui::transfer; public fun transfer<T: key>(obj: T, recipient: address); In the next example, you can see how it can be used in a module that defines and sends an object to the transaction sender. module book::transfer_to_sender; /// A struct with `key` is an object. The first field is `id: UID`! public struct AdminCap has key { id: UID } /// `init` function is a special function that is called when the module /// is published. It is a good place to create application objects. fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) { // Create a new `AdminCap` object, in this scope. let admin_cap = AdminCap { id: object::new(ctx) }; // Transfer the object to the transaction sender. transfer::transfer(admin_cap, ctx.sender()); // admin_cap is gone! Can't be accessed anymore. } /// Transfers the `AdminCap` object to the `recipient`. Thus, the recipient /// becomes the owner of the object, and only they can access it. public fun transfer_admin_cap(cap: AdminCap, recipient: address) { transfer::transfer(cap, recipient); } When the module is published, the init function will get called, and the AdminCap object which we created there will be transferred to the transaction sender. The ctx.sender() function returns the sender address for the current transaction. Once the AdminCap has been transferred to the sender, for example, to 0xa11ce, the sender, and only the sender, will be able to access the object. The object is now account owned. Account owned objects are a subject to true ownership - only the account owner can access them. This is a fundamental concept in the Sui storage model. Let's extend the example with a function that uses AdminCap to authorize a mint of a new object and its transfer to another address: /// Some `Gift` object that the admin can `mint_and_transfer`. public struct Gift has key { id: UID } /// Creates a new `Gift` object and transfers it to the `recipient`. public fun mint_and_transfer( _: &AdminCap, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext ) { let gift = Gift { id: object::new(ctx) }; transfer::transfer(gift, recipient); } The mint_and_transfer function is a public function that \"could\" be called by anyone, but it requires an AdminCap object to be passed as the first argument by reference. Without it, the function will not be callable. This is a simple way to restrict access to privileged functions called Capability. Because the AdminCap object is account owned, only 0xa11ce will be able to call the mint_and_transfer function. The Gifts sent to recipients will also be account owned, each gift being unique and owned exclusively by the recipient. A quick recap: transfer function is used to send an object to an address; The object becomes account owned and can only be accessed by the recipient; Functions can be gated by requiring an object to be passed as an argument, creating a capability.","s":"Transfer","u":"/docusaurus-test/storage/storage-functions","h":"#transfer","p":1195},{"i":1204,"t":"The transfer::freeze_object function is a public function that is used to put an object into an immutable state. Once an object is frozen, it can never be changed, and it can be accessed by anyone by immutable reference. The function signature is as follows, only accepts a type with the key ability. Just like all other storage functions, it takes the object by value: module sui::transfer; public fun freeze_object<T: key>(obj: T); Let's expand on the previous example and add a function that allows the admin to create a Config object and freeze it: /// Some `Config` object that the admin can `create_and_freeze`. public struct Config has key { id: UID, message: String } /// Creates a new `Config` object and freezes it. public fun create_and_freeze( _: &AdminCap, message: String, ctx: &mut TxContext ) { let config = Config { id: object::new(ctx), message }; // Freeze the object so it becomes immutable. transfer::freeze_object(config); } /// Returns the message from the `Config` object. /// Can access the object by immutable reference! public fun message(c: &Config): String { c.message } Config is an object that has a message field, and the create_and_freeze function creates a new Config and freezes it. Once the object is frozen, it can be accessed by anyone by immutable reference. The message function is a public function that returns the message from the Config object. Config is now publicly available by its ID, and the message can be read by anyone. Function definitions are not connected to the object's state. It is possible to define a function that takes a mutable reference to an object that is used as frozen. However, it won't be callable on a frozen object. The message function can be called on an immutable Config object, however, two functions below are not callable on a frozen object: // === Functions below can't be called on a frozen object! === /// The function can be defined, but it won't be callable on a frozen object. /// Only immutable references are allowed. public fun message_mut(c: &mut Config): &mut String { &mut c.message } /// Deletes the `Config` object, takes it by value. /// Can't be called on a frozen object! public fun delete_config(c: Config) { let Config { id, message: _ } = c; id.delete() } To summarize: transfer::freeze_object function is used to put an object into an immutable state; Once an object is frozen, it can never be changed, deleted or transferred, and it can be accessed by anyone by immutable reference;","s":"Freeze","u":"/docusaurus-test/storage/storage-functions","h":"#freeze","p":1195},{"i":1206,"t":"Since the transfer::freeze_object signature accepts any type with the key ability, it can take an object that was created in the same scope, but it can also take an object that was owned by an account.

For security concerns, we would not want to freeze the AdminCap object - it would be a security risk to allow access to it to anyone. However, we can freeze the Gift object that was minted and transferred to the recipient: Single Owner -> Immutable conversion is possible! /// Freezes the `Gift` object so it becomes immutable. public fun freeze_gift(gift: Gift) { transfer::freeze_object(gift); }","s":"Owned -> Frozen","u":"/docusaurus-test/storage/storage-functions","h":"#owned---frozen","p":1195},{"i":1208,"t":"The transfer::share_object function is a public function used to put an object into a shared state.

This is a special case in the Sui storage model, and it is used to allow the deletion of shared objects. To show how it works, we will create a function that creates and shares a Config object and then another one that deletes it: /// Creates a new `Config` object and shares it. public fun create_and_share(message: String, ctx: &mut TxContext) { let config = Config { id: object::new(ctx), message }; // Share the object so it becomes shared. transfer::share_object(config); } The create_and_share function creates a new Config object and shares it.

However, if the function returned the Config object back or attempted to freeze or transfer it, the Sui Verifier would reject the transaction. // Won't work! public fun transfer_shared(c: Config, to: address) { transfer::transfer(c, to); } To summarize: share_object function is used to put an object into a shared state; Once an object is shared, it can be accessed by anyone by a mutable reference; Shared objects can be deleted, but they can't be transferred or frozen.","s":"Special Case: Shared Object Deletion","u":"/docusaurus-test/storage/storage-functions","h":"#special-case-shared-object-deletion","p":1195},{"i":1212,"t":"Now that you know main features of the transfer module, you can start building more complex applications on Sui that involve storage operations.

Parameters that follow it define the actual commands and actions that the transaction will perform. The first two calls we make are utility calls to set the sender address to the command inputs and set the gas budget for the transaction. # sets the gas budget for the transaction --gas-budget 100000000 \\n # registers a variable \"sender=@...\" --assign sender @$MY_ADDRESS \\n Then we perform the actual call to a function in the package. We use the --move-call followed by the package ID, the module name, and the function name. In this case, we are calling the new function in the todo_list package. # calls the \"new\" function in the \"todo_list\" package under the $PACKAGE_ID address --move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new The function that we defined actually returns a value, which we want need to store. We use the --assign command to give a name to the returned value. In this case, we are calling it list. And then we transfer the object to our account. --move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::new \\ # assigns the result of the \"new\" function to the \"list\" variable (from the previous step) --assign list \\ # transfers the object to the sender --transfer-objects \"[list]\" sender Once the command is constructed, you can run it in the terminal. If everything is correct, you should see the output similar to the one we had in previous sections. The output will contain the transaction digest, the transaction data, and the transaction effects.

The command will look like this: $ sui client ptb \\ --gas-budget 100000000 \\ --move-call $PACKAGE_ID::todo_list::add @$LIST_ID \"'Finish the Hello, Sui chapter'\" In this command, we are calling the add function in the todo_list package. The function takes two arguments: the list object and the item to add. The item is a string, so we need to wrap it in single quotes. The command will add the item to the list. If everything is correct, you should see the output similar to the one we had in previous sections. Now you can check the list object to see if the item was added. $ sui client object $LIST_ID The output should contain the item that you have added. ╭───────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ objectId │ 0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553 │ │ version │ 24 │ │ digest │ FGcXH8MGpMs5BdTnC62CQ3VLAwwexYg2id5DKU7Jr9aQ │ │ objType │ 0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList │ │ owner │ ╭──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ AddressOwner │ 0x091ef55506ad814920adcef32045f9078f2f6e9a72f4cf253a1e6274157380a1 │ │ │ │ ╰──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ prevTx │ EJVK6FEHtfTdCuGkNsU1HcrmUBEN6H6jshfcptnw8Yt1 │ │ storageRebate │ 1558000 │ │ content │ ╭───────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ dataType │ moveObject │ │ │ │ │ type │ 0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList │ │ │ │ │ hasPublicTransfer │ true │ │ │ │ │ fields │ ╭───────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ id │ ╭────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ id │ 0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553 │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ╰────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ items │ ╭─────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ finish the Hello, Sui chapter │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ╰─────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ╰───────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ │ │ │ ╰───────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ ╰───────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ A JSON representation of the object can be obtained by adding the --json flag to the command. $ sui client object $LIST_ID --json { \"objectId\": \"0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553\", \"version\": \"24\", \"digest\": \"FGcXH8MGpMs5BdTnC62CQ3VLAwwexYg2id5DKU7Jr9aQ\", \"type\": \"0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList\", \"owner\": { \"AddressOwner\": \"0x091ef55506ad814920adcef32045f9078f2f6e9a72f4cf253a1e6274157380a1\" }, \"previousTransaction\": \"EJVK6FEHtfTdCuGkNsU1HcrmUBEN6H6jshfcptnw8Yt1\", \"storageRebate\": \"1558000\", \"content\": { \"dataType\": \"moveObject\", \"type\": \"0x468daa33dfcb3e17162bbc8928f6ec73744bb08d838d1b6eb94eac99269b29fe::todo_list::TodoList\", \"hasPublicTransfer\": true, \"fields\": { \"id\": { \"id\": \"0x20e0bede16de8a728ab25e228816b9059b45ebea49c8ad384e044580b2d3e553\" }, \"items\": [\"Finish the Hello, Sui chapter\"] } } }","s":"Passing Objects to Functions","u":"/docusaurus-test/your-first-move/hello-sui","h":"#passing-objects-to-functions","p":1237},{"i":1274,"t":"You can chain multiple commands in a single transaction.

The arguments of the macro are not evaluated eagerly like a normal function, and instead are substituted by expression. In addition, the caller can supply code to the macro via lambdas. These expression substitution mechanics make macro functions similar to macros found in other programming languages; however, they are more constrained in Move than you might expect from other languages. The parameters and return values of macro functions are still typed--though this can be partially relaxed with the _ type. The upside of this restriction however, is that macro functions can be used anywhere a normal function can be used, which is notably helpful with method syntax. A more extensive syntactic macro system may come in the future.","s":"Macro Functions","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"","p":1277},{"i":1280,"t":"macro functions have a similar syntax to normal functions. However, all type parameter names and all parameter names must start with a $. Note that _ can still be used by itself, but not as a prefix, and $_ must be used instead. <visibility>? macro fun <identifier><[$type_parameters: constraint],*>([$identifier: type],*): <return_type> <function_body> For example, the following macro function takes a vector and a lambda, and applies the lambda to each element of the vector to construct a new vector. macro fun map<$T, $U>($v: vector<$T>, $f: |$T| -> $U): vector<$U> { let mut v = $v; v.reverse(); let mut i = 0; let mut result = vector[]; while (!v.is_empty()) { result.push_back($f(v.pop_back())); i = i + 1; }; result } The $ is there to indicate that the parameters (both type and value parameters) do not behave like their normal, non-macro counterparts. For type parameters, they can be instantiated with any type (even a reference type & or &mut), and they will satisfy any constraint. Similarly for parameters, they will not be evaluated eagerly, and instead the argument expression will be substituted at each usage.","s":"Syntax","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#syntax","p":1277},{"i":1282,"t":"Lambdas are a new type of expression that can only be used with macros. These are used to pass code from the caller into the body of the macro. While the substitution is done at compile time, they are used similarly to anonymous functions, lambdas, or closures in other languages. As seen in the example above ($f: |$T| -> $U), lambda types are defined with the syntax |<type>,*| (-> <type>)? A few examples |u64, u64| -> u128 // a lambda that takes two u64s and returns a u128 |&mut vector<u8>| -> &mut u8 // a lambda that takes a &mut vector<u8> and returns a &mut u8 If the return type is not annotated, it is unit () by default. // the following are equivalent |&mut vector<u8>, u64| |&mut vector<u8>, u64| -> () Lambda expressions are then defined at the call site of the macro with the syntax |(<identifier> (: <type>)?),*| <expression> |(<identifier> (: <type>)?),*| -> <type> { <expression> } Note that if the return type is annotated, the body of the lambda must be enclosed in {}. Using the map macro defined above let v = vector[1, 2, 3]; let doubled: vector<u64> = map!(v, |x| 2 * x); let bytes: vector<vector<u8>> = map!(v, |x| std::bcs::to_bytes(&x)); And with type annotations let doubled: vector<u64> = map!(v, |x: u64| 2 * x); // return type annotation optional let bytes: vector<vector<u8>> = map!(v, |x: u64| -> vector<u8> { std::bcs::to_bytes(&x) });","s":"Lambdas","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#lambdas","p":1277},{"i":1284,"t":"Lambda expressions can also refer to variables in the scope where the lambda is defined.

However, the body of the function is not type checked until the macro is expanded. This means that not all usages of a given macro may be valid. For example macro fun add_one<$T>($x: $T): $T { $x + 1 } The above macro will not type check if $T is not a primitive integer type. This can be particularly useful in conjunction with method syntax, where the function is not resolved until after the macro is expanded. macro fun call_foo<$T, $U>($x: $T): &$U { $x.foo() } This macro will only expand successfully if $T has a method foo that returns a reference &$U. As described in the hygiene section, foo will be resolved based on the scope where call_foo was defined--not where it was expanded.","s":"Typing","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#typing","p":1277},{"i":1290,"t":"Type parameters can be instantiated with any type, including reference types & and &mut. They can also be instantiated with tuple types, though the utility of this is limited currently since tuples cannot be bound to a variable. This relaxation forces the constraints of a type parameter to be satisfied at the call site in a way that does not normally occur. It is generally recommended however to add all necessary constraints to a type parameter. For example public struct NoAbilities() public struct CopyBox<T: copy> has copy, drop { value: T } macro fun make_box<$T>($x: $T): CopyBox<$T> { CopyBox { value: $x } } This macro will expand only if $T is instantiated with a type with the copy ability. make_box!(1); // Valid! make_box!(NoAbilities()); // Error! 'NoAbilities' does not have the copy ability The suggested declaration of make_box would be to add the copy constraint to the type parameter. This then communicates to the caller that the type must have the copy ability. macro fun make_box<$T: copy>($x: $T): CopyBox<$T> { CopyBox { value: $x } } One might reasonably ask then, why have this relaxation if the recommendation is not to use it? The constraints on type parameters simply cannot be enforced in all cases because the bodies are not checked until expansion. In the following example, the copy constraint on $T is not necessary in the signature, but is necessary in the body. macro fun read_ref<$T>($r: &$T): $T { *$r } If however, you want to have an extremely relaxed type signature, it is instead recommended to use the _ type.","s":"Type Parameters","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#type-parameters","p":1277},{"i":1292,"t":"Normally, the _ placeholder type is used in expressions to allow for partial annotations of type arguments. However, with macro functions, the _ type can be used in place of type parameters to relax the signature for any type. This should increase the ergonomics of declaring \"generic\" macro functions. For example, we could take any combination of integers and add them together. macro fun add($x: _, $y: _, $z: _): u256 { ($x as u256) + ($y as u256) + ($z as u256) } Additionally, the _ type can be instantiated multiple times with different types. For example public struct Box<T> has copy, drop, store { value: T } macro fun create_two($f: |_| -> Box<_>): (Box<u8>, Box<u16>) { ($f(0u8), $f(0u16)) } If we declared the function with type parameters instead, the types would have to unify to a common type, which is not possible in this case. macro fun create_two<$T>($f: |$T| -> Box<$T>): (Box<u8>, Box<u16>) { ($f(0u8), $f(0u16)) // ^^^^ Error! expected `u8` but found `u16` } ... let (a, b) = create_two!(|value| Box { value }); In this case, $T must be instantiated with a single type, but inference finds that $T must be bound to both u8 and u16. There is a tradeoff however, as the _ type conveys less meaning and intention for the caller. Consider map macro from above re-declared with _ instead of $T and $U. macro fun map($v: vector<_>, $f: |_| -> _): vector<_> { There is no longer any indication of behavior of $f at the type level. The caller must gain understanding from comments or the body of the macro.","s":"_ Type","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#_-type","p":1277},{"i":1294,"t":"The body of the macro is substituted into the call site at compile time. Each parameter is replaced by the expression, not the value, of its argument. For lambdas, additional local variables can have values bound within the context of the macro body. Taking a very simple example macro fun apply($f: |u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x) } With the call site let incremented = apply!(|x| x + 1, 5); This will roughly be expanded to let incremented = { let x = { 5 }; { x + 1 } }; Again, the value of x is not substituted, but the expression 5 is. This might mean that an argument is evaluated multiple times, or not at all, depending on the body of the macro. macro fun dup($f: |u64, u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x, $x) } let sum = dup!(|x, y| x + y, foo()); is expanded to let sum = { let x = { foo() }; let y = { foo() }; { x + y } }; Note that foo() will be called twice. Which would not happen if dup were a normal function. It is often recommended to create predictable evaluation behavior by binding arguments to local variables. macro fun dup($f: |u64, u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { let a = $x; $f(a, a) } Now that same call site will expand to let sum = { let a = { foo() }; { let x = { a }; let y = { a }; { x + y } } };","s":"Expansion and Substitution","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#expansion-and-substitution","p":1277},{"i":1296,"t":"In the example above, the dup macro had a local variable a that was used to bind the argument $x. You might ask, what would happen if the variable was instead named x? Would that conflict with the x in the lambda? The short answer is, no. macro functions are hygienic, meaning that the expansion of macros and lambdas will not accidentally capture variables from another scope. The compiler does this by associating a unique number with each scope. When the macro is expanded, the macro body gets its own scope. Additionally, the arguments are re-scoped on each usage. Modifying the dup macro to use x instead of a macro fun dup($f: |u64, u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { let a = $x; $f(a, a) } The expansion of the call site // let sum = dup!(|x, y| x + y, foo()); let sum = { let x#1 = { foo() }; { let x#2 = { x#1 }; let y#2 = { x#1 }; { x#2 + y#2 } } }; This is an approximation of the compiler's internal representation, some details are omitted for the simplicity of this example. And each usage of an argument is re-scoped so that the different usages do not conflict. macro fun apply_twice($f: |u64| -> u64, $x: u64): u64 { $f($x) + $f($x) } let result = apply_twice!(|x| x + 1, { let x = 5; x }); Expands to let result = { { let x#1 = { let x#2 = { 5 }; x#2 }; { x#1 + x#1 } } + { let x#3 = { let x#4 = { 5 }; x#4 }; { x#3 + x#3 } } }; Similar to variable hygiene, method resolution is also scoped to the macro definition. For example public struct S { f: u64, g: u64 } fun f(s: &S): u64 { s.f } fun g(s: &S): u64 { s.g } use fun f as foo; macro fun call_foo($s: &S): u64 { let s = $s; s.foo() } The method call foo will in this case always resolve to the function f, even if call_foo is used in a scope where foo is bound to a different function, such as g. fun example(s: &S): u64 { use fun g as foo; call_foo!(s) // expands to 'f(s)', not 'g(s)' } Due to this though, unused use fun declarations might not get warnings in modules with macro functions.","s":"Hygiene","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/functions/macros","h":"#hygiene","p":1277},{"i":1298,"t":"Similar to variable hygiene, control flow constructs are also always scoped to where they are defined, not to where they are expanded. macro fun maybe_div($x: u64, $y: u64): u64 { let x = $x; let y = $y; if (y == 0) return 0; x / y } At the call site, return will always return from the macro body, not from the caller. let result: vector<u64> = vector[maybe_div!(10, 0)]; Will expand to let result: vector<u64> = vector['a: { let x = { 10 }; let y = { 0 }; if (y == 0) return 'a 0; x / y }]; Where return 'a 0 will return to the block 'a: { ... } and not to the caller's body.

The following example demonstrates $s not being evaluated with an argument of foo(). maybe_s!(foo(), false) // does not abort It becomes more clear as to why it does not abort when looking at the expanded form if (false) foo() else S() However, when using method syntax, the first argument is evaluated before the macro is expanded.

Take the following: fun f(x: MyEnum) { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1, true) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, MyEnum::Variant(..) => 3, MyEnum::OtherVariant(..) => 4, } f(MyEnum::Variant(1, true)); // returns 1 f(MyEnum::Variant(2, true)); // returns 3 f(MyEnum::OtherVariant(false, 3)); // returns 2 f(MyEnum::OtherVariant(true, 3)); // returns 2 f(MyEnum::OtherVariant(true, 2)); // returns 4 This is saying that \"if x is MyEnum::Variant with the fields 1 and true, then return 1. If it is MyEnum::OtherVariant with any value for the first field, and 3 for the second, then return 2. If it is MyEnum::Variant with any fields, then return 3. Finally, if it is MyEnum::OtherVariant with any fields, then return 4\". You can also nest patterns. So, if you wanted to match either 1, 2, or 10, instead of just matching 1 in the previous MyEnum::Variant, you could do so with an or-pattern: fun f(x: MyEnum) { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1 | 2 | 10, true) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, MyEnum::Variant(..) => 3, MyEnum::OtherVariant(..) => 4, } f(MyEnum::Variant(1, true)); // returns 1 f(MyEnum::Variant(2, true)); // returns 1 f(MyEnum::Variant(10, true)); // returns 1 f(MyEnum::Variant(10, false)); // returns 3","s":"Matching Constructors","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/control-flow/pattern-matching","h":"#matching-constructors","p":1339},{"i":1358,"t":"Additionally, match bindings are subject to the same ability restrictions as other aspects of Move. In particular, the compiler will signal an error if you try to match a value (not-reference) without drop using a wildcard, as the wildcard expects to drop the value. Similarly, if you bind a non-drop value using a binder, it must be used in the right-hand side of the match arm. In addition, if you fully destruct that value, you have unpacked it, matching the semantics of non-drop struct unpacking.

If the series of match arms is not exhaustive, the compiler will raise an error. Note that any arm with a guard expression does not contribute to match exhaustion, as it might fail to match at runtime. As an example, a match on a u8 is exhaustive only if it matches on every number from 0 to 255 inclusive, unless there is a wildcard or variable pattern present. Similarly, a match on a bool would need to match on both true and false, unless there is a wildcard or variable pattern present. For structs, because there is only one type of constructor for the type, only one constructor needs to be matched, but the fields within the struct need to be matched exhaustively as well. Conversely, enums may define multiple variants, and each variant must be matched (including any sub-fields) for the match to be considered exhaustive. Because underscores and variables are wildcards that match anything, they count as matching all values of the type they are matching on in that position. Additionally, the multi-arity wildcard pattern .. can be used to match on multiple values within a struct or enum variant. To see some examples of non-exhaustive matches, consider the following: public enum MyEnum { Variant(u64, bool), OtherVariant(bool, u64), } public struct Pair<T>(T, T) fun f(x: MyEnum): u8 { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1, true) => 1, MyEnum::Variant(_, _) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, // ERROR: not exhaustive as the value `MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 4)` is not matched. } } fun match_pair_bool(x: Pair<bool>): u8 { match (x) { Pair(true, true) => 1, Pair(true, false) => 1, Pair(false, false) => 1, // ERROR: not exhaustive as the value `Pair(false, true)` is not matched. } } These examples can then be made exhaustive by adding a wildcard pattern to the end of the match arm, or by fully matching on the remaining values: fun f(x: MyEnum): u8 { match (x) { MyEnum::Variant(1, true) => 1, MyEnum::Variant(_, _) => 1, MyEnum::OtherVariant(_, 3) => 2, // Now exhaustive since this will match all values of MyEnum::OtherVariant MyEnum::OtherVariant(..) => 2, } } fun match_pair_bool(x: Pair<bool>): u8 { match (x) { Pair(true, true) => 1, Pair(true, false) => 1, Pair(false, false) => 1, // Now exhaustive since this will match all values of Pair<bool> Pair(false, true) => 1, } }","s":"Exhaustiveness","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/control-flow/pattern-matching","h":"#exhaustiveness","p":1339},{"i":1362,"t":"As previously mentioned, you can add a guard to a match arm by adding an if clause after the pattern.

After a move occurs, the local variable is unavailable, even if the value's type has the copy ability. let x = 1; let y = move x + 1; // ------ Local was moved here let z = move x + 2; // Error! // ^^^^^^ Invalid usage of local 'x' y + z","s":"Move and Copy","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/variables","h":"#move-and-copy","p":1369},{"i":1406,"t":"Move's type system will prevent a value from being used after it is moved.

The algorithm for doing so is quite simple: Any value with the copy ability is given a copy. Any reference (both mutable &mut and immutable &) is given a copy. Except under special circumstances where it is made a move for predictable borrow checker errors. This will happen once the reference is no longer used. Any other value is given a move. Given the structs public struct Foo has copy, drop, store { f: u64 } public struct Coin has store { value: u64 } we have the following example let s = b\"hello\"; let foo = Foo { f: 0 }; let coin = Coin { value: 0 }; let coins = vector[Coin { value: 0 }, Coin { value: 0 }]; let s2 = s; // copy let foo2 = foo; // copy let coin2 = coin; // move let coins2 = coin; // move let x = 0; let b = false; let addr = @0x42; let x_ref = &x; let coin_ref = &mut coin2; let x2 = x; // copy let b2 = b; // copy let addr2 = @0x42; // copy let x_ref2 = x_ref; // copy let coin_ref2 = coin_ref; // copy","s":"Inference","u":"/docusaurus-test/reference/variables","h":"#inference","p":1369},{"i":1410,"t":"The rapid evolution of the Move language and its ecosystem has rendered many older practices outdated.
